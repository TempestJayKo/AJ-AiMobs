Ability to kill the mob and track its heath with

### This is not a datapack, this is a function file. 
                                                                                         V aimob should go in this one 
I would reccomend you to create a seperate datapack for all your Models and for your game datapack.

How to install

On most code editors if you highlight a text and press ctrl + f you will be given the option to change similer texts on the page shown.

Replace the <"project:name"> text (Including the <>) to your project name.

Replace the <walk_animation> with your walking animation name listed in the animate tab in BlokbBnch

Replace the <idle_animation> with your idle animation name listed in the animate tab in BlokenbBenches

Replace the <attack_animation> with your walking animation name listed in the animate tab in Blocbechers


If this doesnt get updated before or after Animated Java v0.3.10. 

yell at me on discord or change  all "function <project:name>:aimob" to "function <animated_java:<project:name>/aimob"
